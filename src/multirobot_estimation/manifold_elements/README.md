# manifold_elements

Manifold elements which provides operations that allow easy use in traditional algorithms following the approach in [1]. The implementation is heavily inspired by the [lightweight_filtering](https://bitbucket.org/bloesch/lightweight_filtering) library.

**Note: Requires C++14 support in the compiler, which is present in GCC versions >= 5 and Clang versions >= 3.4**
